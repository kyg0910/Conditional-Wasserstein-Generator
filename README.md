# Introduction
This supplementary file provides the implementation used for the results in "Conditional Wasserstein Generator (CWG)" accepted for IEEE TPAMI 2022. This code is based on the official Github code of [stochastic video generation with a learned prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07687) by Emily Denton and Rob Fergus [1].

The pretrained pytorch models can be downloaded from the link in the attached txt file.
